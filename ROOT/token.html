                      The Great Red Shark is a creature of singular vision and conviction, my friends. He knows what he wants, and he won't settle for anything less. And let me tell you, what he wants is the Merikyan (M) token. To the Great Red Shark, every other token and currency is just a pile of shitcoins, even the almighty US dollar. No, the Great Red Shark is convinced that the M token is the only game in town worth playing. He's all in on this baby, and he's not looking back. The Great Red Shark is a man who knows what he wants, and he's not afraid to go out and get it. And in his eyes, there's no other option worth considering. That's the Great Red Shark for you - a true visionary, a man ahead of his time
